/**
 * This file is exclusively for being able to run your nodes through an IDE (as opposed to using deployNodes)
 * Do not use in a production environment.
 *
 * To debug your CorDapp:
 *
 * 1. Run the "Run Template CorDapp" run configuration.
 * 2. Wait for all the nodes to start.
 * 3. Note the debug ports for each node, which should be output to the console. The "Debug CorDapp" configuration runs
 *    with port 5007, which should be "PartyA". In any case, double-check the console output to be sure.
 * 4. Set your breakpoints in your CorDapp code.
 * 5. Run the "Debug CorDapp" remote debug run configuration.
